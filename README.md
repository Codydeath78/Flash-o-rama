## WELCOME TO FLASH-O-RAMA

In this SAAS application, you can create flashcards just by writing a prompt to AI and AI will do all the work by making flashcards so you can have study flashcards for exams, tests, or quizzes. In addition, this application isn't limited to an educational setting, you can use the AI to make any type of set of flashcards you desire to learn something new or explore subjects and ideas to further enhance your understanding of the world.

## SUBSCRIPTION TIERS

In this application, there are two tiers. Basic subscription allows users to access basic flashcard features, however they have limited amount of storage they can save on their account. Pro subscription doesn't have limited storage, in fact, it contains unlimited flashcards and storage space meaning users can create as many flashcard sets as they desire.

## GENERATE FLASHCARDS

Users have free range of creating the amount of flashcards and what the subject of the prompt the AI should create when the user submits their request. The number of flashcards range from 1 - 100 per set. The user can type any subject into the prompt to generate any set of flashcards.

## YOUR FLASHCARD SETS

Users can navigate to their respective flashcard set by searching the set by name or scrolling down to find the exact set. Moreover, when the user selects their desired set, they can visually see when the set was created and even download the flashcard set as a PDF for future reference. In addition, the application has a neat feature where the user can use their arrow keys to navigate from flashcard to flashcard without the need to scroll down and manually find the flashcard. This feature saves time and gets straight to the point. The selected flashcard is marked blue to notify the user their current flashcard position they are viewing. Furthermore, I implemented voice commands where the user can say "START, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS, or FLIP" to while the browser listens for verbal communcation from user's microphone. The user must grant permission to microphone in order to properly use this feature.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
